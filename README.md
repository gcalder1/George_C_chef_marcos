# TKH Innovation Fellowship - Web Dev A - June 2025

This repository contains the Chef Marco's Restaurant assignment for the beginning of Phase 2.

## What is in here?

This repository contains the files for a backend server using Express as a dependency to handle our HTTP requests and responses. Please make sure to install Express before using!

First, make sure you create your node project first...

``` npm init -y ```

Then, install express as a dependency...

``` npm install Express ```

And you should be all set to go. 

---

Please keep in mind that you must restart the server via your terminal whenever you make and want to see your changes. 

For automatic server refreshes to see updated code in action, consider using [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) as a dev dependency.
